# Oliver Lambson: Personal website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/516af488-f3fa-4492-b18c-81055141835e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/oliverlambson/deploys)

Built to gain some better understanding [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and content management systems for static sites ([Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), in this case).

## What's cool about this?

- CI deployment using Github & Netlify.
- Implementation of a static site content management system (CMS) backend that hooks-in to the CI workflow.
- Employing preview templates in the CMS that use the same React components and styling as the site frontend. This means the live preview reflects how the post will look on the build site, removing the need for separate deploy previews or having to run a local development build to check for styling bugs before pushing to the live branch.

## Why does it exist?

1. I wanted to figure out this stuff before diving in and implementing it on [our business' website](https://www.rubato.guitars).
1. I might end up using it to write some stuff, who knows?
