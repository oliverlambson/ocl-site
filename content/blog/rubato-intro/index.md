<!-- Short answer: it’s interesting, fun, and I want to. Despite the pith, those really are the primary reasons. The rest of this post is essentially a retroactive justification of my feelings.

# 1: The way things were

Before we talk about the material or the broader design principles we use at [Rubato Guitars](https://www.rubato.guitars) I should explain my assessment of the current electric guitar industry (_warning_, opinions ahead).

- Conservative
- Old instrument designs
- Exclusively wood
- Has not maintained sense of innovation from the birth period of the instrument and the eras of the guitar heroes, instead favouring sentimentality and yearning for a time long past

# 2: The way things are

Now on to the title of this post: why carbon fibre? The way I see it, if the electric guitar were to be invented today there is no chance it would be made out of wood. _Especially_ not the woods that are commonplace in the industry. These are a vestige of a different time. Wood is heavy and unreliable, it's primary redeeming factor is that it's cheap. It is so susceptible to changes in the weather that a massive metal rod has to be installed down the centre of a guitar’s neck to fight the uncooperative material. All this means no two wood electric guitars will feel the same or play the same, even if they come off the line one after the other.

Guitarists have, en masse, deemed this unreliability to be a good thing. It’s said that this means if you try a bunch of guitars you will eventually find “the one” and it will be magical. There are a few problems with this. Firstly, this implies that there are a lot of guitars being produced which are duds (or at least sub-par). This makes me very uncomfortable. As a manufacturer you aim for all the products you produce to be good. If they aren’t coming out that way then you find out what’s causing the defects and address it at the source. Rolex don’t send out a bunch of watches that don’t keep time and have slightly skew hands. Those watches may become collectibles due to the rarity of such an occurrence, but no one would dare claim them to be of superior quality or acceptably fit for purpose.

# 3: The way things could be

I think the analogy of luxury watches here is quite appropriate. Automatic watches are nowhere near the best way to keep time, they have a heralded history, and their enthusiasts are obsessive—all good parallels with guitars and their gear-heads. A part of their world consists of historically accurate new watches, and vintage and antique watches. But a far larger part of that world is modern horology. This stays true to the “essence” of what the community sees as a time piece: the automatic movement. Modern materials, production processes and design methodologies are utilised to assist in the ultimate goal of keeping time as best/elegantly as possible without digital assistance.

Turning to the electric guitar, I guess this becomes a philosophical question: what you you believe is the “essence” of an electric guitar? Is being made of wood? Or is it being able to plug something with 6 strings and 20-something frets into an amp and make noise? How critical is wood in this equation? Can we not substitute it with something more appropriate in the end goal of making music?

No doubt, there will always be the vintage stalwarts. There is nothing wrong with this. BMW doesn’t lambaste classic car enthusiasts. Why would they? Classic cars are cool. However, they do not turn to classic cars when working to determine the design of a new model (save for some styling queues, perhaps).

Continuing along this line of thinking, it should now be clear why I don’t see the move away from wood as dramatic or somehow damaging to the guitar. Indeed, Les Pauls and Strats will continue to exist and are certainly iconic. We are after their sound. Should we really have to inherit their drawbacks when we can do better? -->
